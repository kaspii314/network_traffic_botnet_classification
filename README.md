A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack may render a businessâ€™ digital services unusable, costing millions. Harmful network traffic must be identified and blocked as quickly as possible, without disrupting normal network traffic. This is a fundamental capability of many cyber protection solutions, and in this project, we utilize Random Forest to distinguish harmful botnet traffic from normal network traffic.
